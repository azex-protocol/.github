#### `Project title`
AZex Protocol

#### `Project objectives` 
AZex is the first decentralized perpetual exchange on Aleph Zero. Liquidity providers can support multi-asset pools to earn trading fees from market making, swap fees and leverage trading.

#### `What is the projectâ€™s purpose? What problem does it solve?`
  - AZex protocol is the first decentralized perpetual exchange (perpetual DEX) on Aleph Zero. Liquidity providers can support multi-asset pools to earn trading fees from market making, swap fees and leverage trading.
  - Axez brings a product that is a missing piece in the DeFi Ecosystem, perpetual trading. With this product, it will surely attract a large number of new users and create significant transactions for the chain.
  - Azez will become one of the first Layer 1 (L1) networks to support a perpetual DEX, something that is not feasible on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) platforms.
#### `Key ideas and an overview of the architecture;`
  - The ideas:
    - Build a fully on-chain perpetual exchange. Works permissionless and operates entirely based on community involvement.
    - Liquidity providers also act as counterparties to traders, thereby creating real yield for those staking assets and a deep pool for traders.

#### `If possible, any diagrams and screenshots help a lot in understanding the project;`
  - These are two main screens of projects. You can see full users flow on our figma file.
#### `If any smart contracts are deployed, their addresses on the Aleph Zero Testnet;`
- Market's contract address: 5D4uCMt4bfCa2HJymru2pLpYNLFQSa85jyzELCTBFrPvizVB
- Vault's contract address: 5FnrajZLgbQ3YFNULh8ohHamwQYFjkqhBoemWbDLk4P2TTug
#### `Instructions on how to set up and run the project;`
  - With an architecture that separates the frontend from the protocol, you need to run two separate repositories.
